# Alpha - Security Awareness Through Gaming

Alpha is an educational security awareness game developed by Jagaco Games in partnership with Alpha Awareness. It's designed to teach information security concepts through interactive gameplay rather than traditional presentations.

## Play as a Chief Information Security Officer

Assume the role of a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) in a real-time simulation game set in various professional work environments. Your mission is to address security challenges and help colleagues with information security issues as they unfold in a living, breathing virtual workplace.

## Customized Learning Experience

The game adapts scenarios to match players' actual work environments, making security lessons relevant to their daily roles—from administrative staff to C-suite executives. This customization ensures that every player learns security practices directly applicable to their position.

## Dynamic Security Challenges

Security threats occur dynamically throughout the game, requiring players to prevent or mitigate them as incidents unfold. The flexible scenario system presents quest-like challenges including workplace conversations and unfolding security events, ranging from simple situations like unlocked computers to complex challenges like secure remote access procedures.

## Advanced Tracking and Reporting

**For Individual Players:**
- Personal progress tracking
- Targeted improvement suggestions
- Real-time feedback on security decisions

**For Managers:**
- Real-time team and company performance statistics
- Periodic reports identifying organizational security training gaps
- Data-driven insights for security awareness programs
