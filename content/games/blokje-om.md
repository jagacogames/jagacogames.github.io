Blokje Om is a groundbreaking virtual reality traffic training game designed to teach children how to safely navigate traffic while using wheelchairs or mobility scooters. Instead of learning on real streets with real dangers, children can practice in a safe, controlled virtual environment.

## Mission-Based Learning

Players complete various missions through a virtual city, encountering cars, cyclists, trucks, buses, and pedestrians along the way. The goal is simple: safely make it to your destination while learning proper mobility scooter operation and developing crucial traffic awareness skills.

## Safe Learning Environment

The virtual environment eliminates the risk of real-world injuries while providing varied and challenging traffic scenarios. Children can make mistakes, learn from them, and build confidence before taking their skills to real streets.

## Professional Monitoring Tools

The game includes specialized tools for therapists and mentors to observe player behavior in detail, including whether children look both ways before crossing streets and how they react to different traffic situations. This enables more effective therapeutic interventions with reduced man-hours.

## Essential Skills Development

**Traffic Safety:**
- Looking both ways before crossing
- Understanding right-of-way rules
- Recognizing traffic signs and signals
- Responding to different vehicle types

**Mobility Control:**
- Acceleration and deceleration management
- Steering and maneuvering in tight spaces
- Safe stopping procedures

**Navigation Skills:**
- Wayfinding using visual landmarks
- GPS navigation training
- Route planning and spatial awareness

## Target Audiences

**For Therapists and Rehabilitation Centers:**
Professional training tool that reduces therapy time while improving outcomes. The game provides detailed analytics on patient progress and areas needing improvement.

**For Parents:**
Prepare your children for safe, independent mobility in traffic. Practice at home in a controlled environment before venturing into real-world situations.

**For Children:**
An engaging, game-like experience that makes learning traffic safety fun and interactive while building real-world skills.

## Development Partnership

Created in collaboration with the Smart Lab at Sophia Revalidatie in The Hague, which was the first organization to implement Blokje Om therapeutically. The partnership ensures the game meets real therapeutic needs and educational standards.

## Platform Requirements

- **VR Headsets:** Oculus Rift or HTC Vive required
- Suitable play space for VR movement
- Compatible PC hardware
