# Emulating Style

One of the hardest things as an artist is to emulate someone else's style. To the author, it is also one of the more rewarding things to do.

## The Challenge

Emulating styles proves difficult for most people, mainly because they attempt to copy someone who is far more proficient in certain artistic aspects and has completed dozens of drawings in the same style. When starting fresh with a new style, the keys to success are patience and honest self-criticism.

## The Process

After several weeks of trial and error, the author successfully emulated Myron's artistic style—close enough that average players wouldn't notice differences in-game.

### Ancient Ruins Asset
The author was tasked with creating an 'ancient ruins' prop for game levels. The sketch received approval, but upon coloring it, significant stylistic differences from Myron's similar assets became apparent, prompting a redesign effort.

### Learning Through Copying
Rather than designing something new while mimicking the style, the author decided to make "carbon copies" of existing artwork, as this approach proved easier than generating original content in an unfamiliar style.

### The Essenite Storage Attempt
After hours attempting to copy the Essenite storage asset, the author abandoned the effort due to inaccurate sketch lines and incorrect shading techniques.

### Simplest Asset Trial
Working with Myron's simplest creation, the author initially applied shading around line-art rather than over it, resulting in splotchy colors and an undesirable appearance.

### Second Attempt Success
Using proper shading techniques, the author achieved much closer results, with only minor differences in sketch accuracy and slightly lighter shading compared to the original.
