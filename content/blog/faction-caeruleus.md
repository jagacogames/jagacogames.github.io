We are excited to begin revealing more of Ungoverned Lands starting with one of the playable factions. We are going to include multiple of them which will play a big role in the game, each with their own strengths and weaknesses but also unique looks and background.

Our first faction goes by the name Caeruleus, highly organized with heavy rulership overseeing everything within their empire.

We want to keep you all informed with new stuff along the way and that does involve Work In Progress (or WIP) information and images. Keeping a more transparent stance on the process which will hopefully be as interesting and exciting for you as it is for us. As mentioned, the factions will have both gameplay and lore-wise differences. Helping to create a new and interesting environment for everyone to play in. Below you can find a bit of insight on the lives and ruling of our Caeruleus governors.

*Signed in blood they dedicate their lives to the royal family. All citizens of 'the Caeruleus faction' are bound to serve and those who do not support the empire in any of their ways are to be exiled or even executed. This keeps the lands pure, clean and all the rewards their own. The royals rule with an iron fist, their will is law which is spread in different branches maintaining efficiency. All who follow them do so unquestioning for the greater good.*

*The Caeruleus people show their support through any means necessary, advancing the empire, strengthening their cause. Helping in the aid of their brethren and sisters or taking up a role on the front lines them selfs. Defending the lands, exploiting resources, exploring new grounds, building on new territory. Others stay within the protected regions, fueling the machine through production, research, administration and all other means to keep all running smooth. The great abundance of working force and non-royals does result in spread class. Without any hold into higher power it can be hard for anyone to be noticed among the crowd, stuck in a lower standard than their true capabilities. Though better than useless and dead.*

*Forcefully organized and efficient in their ways they've managed to amass great riches as the living standard rises with all new land they take. Many follow in the empire's steps, not able to do anything but submit and listen to their higher lords. Those who disagree without rank are brought down. Decades of devotion, isolation and creating a perfect world have shaped the minds of the folks. Most now follow believing purely in the good of their rulers, their caretakers. They obey even in their graves, where ever that may be.*

In the game Caeruleus will take on a more balanced stance in terms of combat. Trying to remain proficient and efficient in all aspects while not necessarily excelling in any. With their organized and relatively wealthy cities they manage to equip all of their forces to high standards as long as they abide in the name of the empire. However, the tools used say nothing of the person who wields it and only the royal and elite have soldiers with the best equipment available.

Ungoverned Lands focuses on the exploration and exploitation of fresh lands containing a new resource called Essenite. These lands are often far and take a long time to travel to and from, thus the need of forward structures for both exploitation and military use. With their industrial prowess, the blue faction creates pre-made kits for their outposts. Wooden planks, posts and other materials are pre-fabricated to be used in many different ways and scenarios. This allows for easy transport and maintenance in far away territories.

Here you can have a closer look at some of their structure designs.

We'll be releasing more information, art and other news over time!
