With the first tier of beta-testing for Ungoverned Lands well underway, (fortunately) no major issues have been found as of now. We have invited a few testers to our headquarters for the "over the shoulder tests", and we have been given many helpful comments and recommendations.

Our testers have been asked to give their critical and honest opinion about Ungoverned Lands, and it is hugely gratifying to see that they're enjoying our game, even in its current state.

The second tier of testing will start after we completed the repair of the found issues, and after the implementation of some of the features our testers suggested.

We are more anxious about the second tier, because Ungoverned Lands will have to run on other computers, which will have very different configurations. Also the debugger won't be attached anymore, so the technical feedback will be harder for us to acquire, should a major issue arise.
