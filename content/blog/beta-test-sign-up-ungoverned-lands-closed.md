The signup period is now closed and we are happy to tell you that we have many participants! We will divide the test in three tiers. This way we can stress-test the game with an increasing number of players every time.

At the moment the game is beta-ready, but we are still working on the systems that will allow you to post comments, bugs, and a server to which the game will send debug-information while you play, which will allow us to fix issues much more easily.

When those systems are ready, the first tier will get their invites.

Depending on the outcome of these tests there might be a second beta round, so keep checking back for progress and other possibilities.
