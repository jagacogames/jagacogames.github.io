The registration period has concluded, and the team reports receiving numerous participant applications. The testing phase will be structured into three sequential tiers, enabling the developers to progressively increase player loads for comprehensive stress testing.

Currently, the game has achieved beta-readiness. However, development continues on critical infrastructure components, including:

- A commenting and bug-reporting system
- A server framework for collecting debug information during gameplay

These systems will facilitate faster identification and resolution of issues. Once completed, invitations will be distributed to the initial tier of testers.

The developers note that depending on how the first testing phase progresses, "there might be a second beta round," encouraging interested parties to monitor the site for future announcements and opportunities to participate.
