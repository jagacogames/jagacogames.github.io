# How to Workflow

Jagaco Games shares development lessons from their new RPG project, highlighting best practices for indie game development.

## 1. Work in Demos (Incremental)

The team emphasizes creating horizontal slices of game systems that feel polished. This forces early bug resolution rather than deferring difficult issues.

**A demo should be a horizontal slice of the game systems and give a general polished experience to the player.**

This approach:
- Forces you to confront hard problems early
- Creates milestone moments for the team
- Provides testable, playable builds
- Prevents feature creep

## 2. Focus on Game Systems

Strategy alternates between system development (odd demos) and content creation (even demos). The quest-system example demonstrates building flexible core mechanics before expanding with side content.

**Build the foundation before the house.**

## 3. Story Development First

Multi-year story planning informed design decisions throughout development. This shifted team discussions from "how" questions to deeper "why" questions about narrative context.

When you know your story, you make better design decisions. "How should this mechanic work?" becomes "Why does this mechanic exist in our world?"

## 4. Engine Maturity

After nearly a decade of in-house engine development, the team now dedicates 95% of effort to game code rather than engine modifications. Recent optimization included implementing Jump Point Search pathfinding.

**There comes a point where your tools should get out of the way.**

## 5. Strategic Porting Delays

Rather than maintaining ports during active development, the team plans porting after stabilizing the core game and engine.

Build for one platform well, then port once the foundation is solid.

## 6. Comprehensive Game Design Documentation

The team uses Azure DevOps Wiki to document all design decisions, enabling early problem identification and consistent reference during implementation.

**Document everything. Future you will thank present you.**

## 7. Perseverance Through Difficult Bugs

The author recounts a three-week struggle with a character pathfinding bug, emphasizing determination and belief in the project.

### The Three-Week Bug

Sometimes you hit a wall. A bug that defies logic, that breaks every assumption, that makes you question everything. The author spent three weeks tracking down a pathfinding issue that seemed impossible.

The solution? Persistence. Belief. Refusing to give up.

**Every impossible bug has a solution. You just haven't found it yet.**

## Key Takeaways

1. **Incremental progress beats perfection**
2. **Systems before content**
3. **Story informs design**
4. **Mature tools enable productivity**
5. **Port strategically, not constantly**
6. **Document relentlessly**
7. **Never give up on your game**

These lessons have shaped how we work at Jagaco. They're hard-won insights from years of development, and we hope they help other indie developers on their journey.
