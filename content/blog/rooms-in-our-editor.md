# Rooms in our Editor

## Overview

The company transformed their single-purpose game into a comprehensive training platform, requiring substantial development effort. This expansion necessitated improvements to their level design tools.

## Editor upgrade

To streamline artist workflows, the development team enhanced the level editor to enable room creation through a simple drag-and-drop mechanism. Previously, designers had to manually position numerous individual wall segments—a tedious process given the quantity of rooms needed per level.

The team drew inspiration from "The Sims 1," specifically its intuitive room-building system, which prompted some weekend research to understand the design approach.

## Implementation

The final solution differs slightly from the original inspiration. Users can now:

- Drag shapes within the editor to establish room outlines
- Progressively add or subtract tiles to refine the room's configuration
- Finalize the room once satisfied with the shape
- Allow the editor to automatically populate interior floor tiles and construct perimeter walls
- Customize both floor and wall appearances

## Results

The enhancement proved effective and significantly accelerated level creation. While representing the initial version of this room-building feature, future use will likely reveal additional refinement opportunities—"which would mean there would be something to program in the future."
