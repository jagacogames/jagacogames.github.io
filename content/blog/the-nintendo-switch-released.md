Two of the three programmers at Jagaco Games acquired Nintendo Switch units with Zelda: Breath of the Wild, significantly impacting office productivity. The team established a workplace policy: "No playing on the Switch during working hours," though demonstrations of game discoveries received brief exceptions.

Despite implementing this rule, late-night gaming sessions extending until 5 a.m. created fatigue challenges the following workday. However, the developers considered the experience worthwhile, praising the game's quality and Nintendo's execution.

## Nintendo's Indie-Friendly Approach

The company highlighted Nintendo's welcoming stance toward independent developers as particularly noteworthy. Jagaco Games expressed interest in developing a Switch title following their November project completion. Development kit costs of $500 appeared reasonable, and adapting their Fire engine to the platform seemed feasible.

The team planned to organize a game jam to evaluate Switch development possibilities before committing to a full indie title.

## Engagement

The post concluded with an invitation for readers to share their Nintendo Switch impressions or suggest game concepts for potential development.
