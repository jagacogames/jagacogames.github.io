Hi All,

The last few months we've been working on starting of Jagaco as a business. For a while there was still one thing missing, the actual registration of the company. So without further ado…

We are happy to announce that as of this week "**Jagaco BV**" is a real company, finally we exist!

Now we are putting our new found feeling of purpose to work and are currently working hard on our first internal release of [Ungoverned Lands](http://jagaco.com/projects/ungoverned-lands/ "Ungoverned Lands").

We're making some real progress, so expect some cool developments updates soon!

For now we'll spread the joy by presenting you with our very first Ungoverned Lands wallpaper, enjoy!
