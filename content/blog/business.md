# We're in Business!

Jagaco has officially registered as a company. After months of preparation, "**Jagaco BV**" is now a legally established business entity.

With this milestone achieved, the team is channeling their newfound momentum into developing their first internal release of *Ungoverned Lands*. The project is progressing well, and the studio promises exciting updates ahead.

To celebrate, Jagaco is sharing the inaugural *Ungoverned Lands* wallpaper with their community. Fans interested in following the studio's progress are encouraged to connect via Twitter and Facebook for regular development announcements.
