We have been steadily working on the RPG that Vincent brought up in our previous post, and are ready to show you the first town in our next game.

We will do a proper introduction of the game at a later point, but in short, our game is an open world RPG that takes a lot of inspiration from the Gameboy Zelda games (puzzles, combat with loads of different enemy types) and a heavy narrative focus, with gathering & crafting to enrich the experience.

We play as a young boy who eventually finds himself involved in adventures far bigger and scarier than the ones he would daydream about, but back at the start of his story, we get to explore his home town.

Currently we are adding things to make the town feel more alive. We already have NPC's with schedules, that go about their business every day, but we feel we can add more life to it by having critters, gently waving reeds, grass and trees. More NPC's also couldn't hurt, as well as some side-quests for the player to interact with.

## A past version

Since we've been working on this game for a couple years already, it shouldn't come to a surprise to anyone that there have been multiple iterations of the town. The structures we placed in the town initially were far too nice for the 'medieval farmers village' look we're going for, so we have moved them to a richer town.

## An older version of the town, with buildings that were way too fancy
