Hello everyone!

It's time to introduce our main project which we've been working on for a while now. We are very excited (and a bit nervous) getting this news out, but our baby cannot grow properly if we don't set it free at some point, right?

## About the Game

**Ungoverned Lands** is a digitally hand painted 2D isometric Real-time strategy game for mobile platforms (initially).

Taking place in distant lands where a new powerful resource has erupted from the grounds. These riches attract governing powers from all over, who would kill for the potential it holds.

Choose your side, which allegiance will you pledge too, show your commanding abilities. Lead your forces into victory taking the lands for their rightful owners as you claim more territory, extending your reach.

Each faction has their own unique appearance, history, units, buildings, strengths and weaknesses.

We will be revealing a lot more details in the near future as we will continue to share the development process.
