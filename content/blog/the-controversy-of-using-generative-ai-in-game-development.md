# The Controversy of Using Generative AI in Game Development

This blog post examines the dual nature of generative AI in game development—highlighting both opportunities and concerns.

## Advantages

AI can accelerate production by generating dialogue, character models, and landscapes, potentially helping indie developers create ambitious projects with smaller teams.

## Concerns

Critics worry about:
- Creative dilution
- Potential replacement of human talent
- Ethical questions regarding training data sourcing
- Whether AI-generated content lacks the "depth and soul" of human creation

## Jagaco Games' Approach

The studio uses AI experimentally but cautiously:

- **Pixel art generation**: Fails completely
- **Concept art**: Serves as a creative starting point for human artists
- **NPC dialogue generation**: Produces technically correct but emotionally "hollow" results
- **Programming assistance**: Proves highly effective as a collaborative tool

## The "How vs. What" Debate

The post explores whether AI should assist with storytelling *method* while humans determine story *substance*. We acknowledge this distinction blurs in practice, as AI suggestions inevitably influence narrative content.

## Conclusion

**AI works best as a collaborator, assisting but not replacing human creators.** Current technology lacks genuine originality and emotional nuance required for standalone creative work.

The future of game development isn't about choosing between AI or humans—it's about finding the right balance where technology amplifies creativity rather than replacing it.
