# Ungoverned Lands Beta Signup

Hi All,

As the development of Ungoverned Lands is nearing its inevitable completion, we have decided to start our Beta test phase soon. So if there are brave souls among you, willing to venture into the unknown; willing to face the bugs ahead and report them back to us… Sign up!

We are planning on releasing to the Windows platforms first, _(Windows Phone 8, Windows 8 (app) and Windows Desktop)_ but in no particular order. Keep in mind that testing on some platforms will start somewhat later than for others, so some of you might not be eligible for beta testing right away.

Not being among the first to play the game might upset some of you, but on the bright side, there should be less bugs to run into when you do get your hands on it.

We hope you want to help us out, and if you are interested, click the link below to sign up!
