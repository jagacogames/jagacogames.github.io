## Alpha, a brief History

This initiative emerged from collaboration between Jagaco and Refreshing Security, an information security consulting firm. Beginning in late 2014, the partners explored how applied games could build cybersecurity awareness.

"Alpha Awareness' goal is to make the world a better and more secure place, which we do by providing (among other things) training sessions and workshops"

## What is it?

Alpha functions as a real-time simulation where players assume the role of a Chief Information Security Officer. Players navigate professional work environments, addressing information security challenges while receiving performance feedback.

## Customizable

The game environment adapts to various organizational contexts. This customization enables players to encounter security scenarios relevant to their specific workplace, making the experience more relatable and impactful.

## Scenario System

The platform features a flexible scenario framework allowing creation of security-focused mini-quests. These range from simple tasks like ensuring unattended computers are locked to complex scenarios involving remote employee network access. The system scales difficulty based on player expertise.

## Reporting

The underlying system tracks player decisions and generates personalized performance reports. Organizations can access aggregated data to identify knowledge gaps and monitor awareness program effectiveness across employee groups.

## What's Next

Planned enhancements include:
- New platform support for mobile and remote access
- User-friendly scenario creation tools
- Expanded environments
- Potential applications beyond information security
