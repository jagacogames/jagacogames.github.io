## Day 0 – Arrival

After a week-long vacation in New York, the author returns to San Francisco after three years. Despite the hotel's poor conditions, they're excited to explore the city again. Their colleague Nick experiences the city's steep streets for the first time. At day's end, they collect GDC passes and explore the Moscone Center, marveling at the gathering of 26,000 game development professionals.

## Day 1 – And so it begins

The conference opens with summit sessions. The author attends "Building a better centaur: AI at a massive scale," learning about GuildWars2's extensible AI architecture. A presentation on Free-to-Play mechanics proves enlightening, discussing how the app store ecosystem evolves. The speaker, a behavioral psychologist, notes that players increasingly reject dishonest monetization—a philosophy aligning with Jagaco's values.

The day overwhelms with inspiring presentations spanning AI, education, and monetization topics.

## Day 2 – The last day of summits

Morning brings a physics presentation focused on numerical methods, eventually connecting to Diablo 3. An idle-games discussion introduces "zero-player games" concepts—titles like Cookie Clicker where the game progresses itself. An afternoon AI disasters presentation showcases real development failures, offering valuable learning opportunities.

John Carmack's upcoming keynote generates excitement among attendees.

## Day 3 – Main conference start

The main expo opens with massive motion capture technology displays. The author notes: "There is A LOT of motion tracking going around."

John Carmack presents on mobile VR, announcing Oculus's consumer release this year alongside Samsung's Gear VR. Microsoft discusses Windows 10 game development and cross-platform hybrid applications. Epic Games representatives discuss free Unreal Engine access (except 5% royalties) and educational opportunities.

Observations include attendees' vibrant hair colors—"yellow (really bright yellow!), lots of blue, red, pink, purple and green."

## Day 4 – The longest day

The longest conference day runs until 18:30. Presentations cover edge detection post-processing in World of Warcraft, Frostbite's scripting solutions using IronPython, and Destiny's multi-threading architecture. The author learns about "fibers" and Intel's Thread Building Blocks for performance-critical multi-threading.

A lunch-hour game store visit proves problematic—wearing the GDC badge attracts crowds of enthusiastic kids treating the author like a celebrity.

## Day 5 – The last day

The final, shortest conference day features DirectX12 optimization presentations, Microsoft's UI scaling research across different platforms and screen densities, and Far Cry 4's global lighting and vegetation rendering.

The author expresses mixed emotions: relief the week concludes while disappointed it passed quickly. They humorously contemplate burning their hotel-damaged clothing rather than attempting cleaning.
