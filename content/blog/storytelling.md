This post discusses the creation of storytelling for an upcoming RPG game at Jagaco Games. The author emphasizes how having a story before game development helps programmers ask better questions about narrative context, not just mechanics.

## The Burden of an Untold Story

The author, a programmer by trade, has carried a story concept for over two decades. Despite winning regional writing contests as a child, programming took priority. The story exists as rough outlines of territories and character backgrounds that influenced previous Jagaco games.

Writing efforts began informally in 2014, then resumed seriously in December 2018 with colleagues from The Hague University, including a published writer. Friendly writing competitions motivated progress through monthly word count challenges.

## Writing as a Programmer

The author approaches writing systematically, researching genre conventions, word counts, and formatting details. This structured methodology provides targets and creative frameworks, though the author acknowledges spending excessive time on layout matters—a problem experienced writers also face.

**The current goal**: 150,000 words across approximately 40 chapters. As of August 2, the manuscript reached 60,000 words, progressing from exploratory writing to planned narrative structure.

## Show Don't Tell

A fundamental writing principle emphasized: demonstrate character emotions and settings through vivid description rather than direct statements.

**Example:** Instead of "She was sad," use "Her lip trembled, and her eyes burned as she tried to keep her tears at bay."

The author applies this selectively, avoiding uncomfortable implications when describing physical appearances across significant age differences.

## Proofreading and Revision

Sharing early drafts proved emotionally challenging. Initial feedback, though carefully worded, felt discouraging. The author realized first drafts function as sketches requiring substantial development.

Recognized weaknesses in the initial version include insufficient character interaction and conflict avoidance reflected in the narrative. The second draft focuses on adding depth while maintaining the foundational structure.

## Lessons Learned

- **Writing is rewriting**: The first draft is just the beginning
- **Structure helps creativity**: Having a framework doesn't limit imagination
- **Feedback hurts but helps**: Criticism is how we grow
- **Story informs design**: Knowing the narrative shapes better game mechanics

The story that started as scattered notes two decades ago is finally becoming real. And while the journey has been challenging, it's also been deeply rewarding.
