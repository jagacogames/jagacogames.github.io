After having worked hard for the last couple of weeks we had to make time for some relaxation and team building. The whole Jagaco crew went to see the new Warcraft movie! We drove a couple of hundred kilometers to see it, because we wanted to see the movie in the largest cinema (or in simplified English: movie theater) of our country. And it was worth it!

Sure some parts of the movie didn't fully cover/honor the lore of the game, but that didn't make the movie less epic. Please make some sequels, and we promise to watch them all!

And now quickly back to work...
