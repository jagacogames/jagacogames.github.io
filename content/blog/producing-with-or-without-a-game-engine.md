# Producing with or without a Game Engine

The decision between building a custom game engine or using an existing one carries significant consequences for game development, affecting the game itself, the development team, and the company's future.

## Staying Competitive

Maintaining competitiveness in gaming requires continuous research into emerging techniques and technologies. However, awareness alone isn't sufficient—developers must make informed decisions about which approaches align with their specific project requirements and constraints.

## Jagaco's Approach

Jagaco Games chose to develop proprietary technology, constructing their engine from scratch and creating supporting tools for their artists. Their tooling ecosystem includes:

- Level editor
- Animation editor
- Bin packing tools for sprite sheet creation
- Custom asset pipeline

## Reasons for Building In-House

The studio identified four primary motivations:

- **Capability and enjoyment** — personal factors driving development teams
- **Monetization potential** — mature technology can generate revenue when licensed to others
- **Perfect customization** — technology tailored precisely to project needs with unlimited modification possibilities
- **Learning experience** — the development process itself provides valuable technical knowledge

## Important Consideration

Developers should remain vigilant about the "Not invented here" syndrome, a tendency where programmers prefer building solutions themselves rather than adopting existing ones. While self-built solutions offer learning benefits, they aren't always the most commercially sensible choice.

## Research Contribution

The author conducted formal research on this topic through a master's course paper, surveying multiple game development companies to analyze factors influencing technology choices in game projects.
