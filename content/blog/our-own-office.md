There comes a time when your hobby is getting out of hand…

We are at a turning point in the existence of Jagaco. The rent of available offices in our home city is relatively low and we were thinking of giving the development of our game(s) a boost in production for some time now.

A few weeks ago we have made a big decision; we are going to rent our own office! yay \o/

It's small, only 46m2 (about 495 ft2), but it's ours! We want to create six workplaces in the office by using old desks from our day-jobs. The most expensive assets are our computers, we're going to buy new gaming PC's and use the 'old' ones (no more than two years old) as development machines.

Two of us have a full-time job (one even has a master study next to that), so we are going to plan as many evenings and days in the weekend to work together at our new location. We've learned in the past that working together in the same room greatly motivates us and the speed of development increases by that, so the future looks bright.

Expect some updates soon when we start putting our stuff in 🙂

If you have cool ideas to make our office even cooler please leave a comment. And yes, we're considering USB rocket launchers!

If you like to keep up with further updates about our office be sure to follow us on Twitter and Facebook.
