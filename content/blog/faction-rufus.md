## Overview

Jagaco Games announces the red faction "Rufus" to complement the previously revealed blue faction "Caeruleus" in their game *Ungoverned Lands*. The developers emphasize that each faction receives unique visual treatment and distinct gameplay characteristics.

## Faction Description

The Rufus represent tribes originating from harsh environments like deserts and wastelands. They pursue power and strength through resourcefulness and persistence. Their society values "glory, strength, and respect," with leadership determined by displays of power. The faction organizes into specialized tribes, each with unique traits suited to their regions.

Structurally, Rufus buildings appear "wild, barbaric, and rickety," constructed from simple, easily-obtained materials. This approach prioritizes rapid construction and resource efficiency over refinement.

## Gameplay Focus

In-game mechanics emphasize damage output over speed. Rufus forces tame wild beasts and wield massive weapons, showcasing their physical prowess through both appearance and combat capability.

The faction quickly adapts to the new "Essenite" resource, establishing outposts near deposits using their straightforward construction methods. Their relentless pursuit of power drives continued expansion.

## Visual Assets

The announcement includes previews of Rufus building structures, demonstrating their distinctive architectural aesthetic aligned with the faction's rough, practical design philosophy.
