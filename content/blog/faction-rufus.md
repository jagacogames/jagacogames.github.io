It has been a while since our last big announcement, specifically of the blue faction, now known as the faction "Caeruleus". What is a game about factions fighting each other with just one faction? So now the predominantly red-faction "Rufus" shows up to join the fray.

Because what else to pit against a faction, who for the most part is blue, right? Supposedly you could just start smacking each other regardless of their alignment… but we're doing it a bit different here. Anyway, we're of course excited to reveal this next big aspect of Ungoverned Lands, as we continue to work our way to getting it all into a playable game. We try to hold true to our previous statements about the factions getting a unique treatment. So these guys sport their own visuals and characteristics. They focus mostly on brute force, but appearances can deceive, and you might never know what lies within.

**Faction Description:**

Tribes strong and persistent in their ways, often hailing from hazardous environments, such as deserts and barren wastelands. Looking to grow in power and claim the strengths of the world, subduing them to their own will. They do not shy away from any challenge, using their resourceful, tenacious nature to find a use in anything. The tribes within Rufus answer to glory, strength, and respect. For them, survival is just the beginning. They are as organized as any other group, even with their wild and almost barbaric tendencies. Each individual bears a sign of strength and power, for them selves and their comrades.

While strong on their own, they work especially well in groups, as knowing each other's different strengths makes them stronger as a whole. Alone hard as stone, but together tall as a wall. The Rufus armies stand strong and large, and would dare any other factions to try to oppose them. The leadership is established by a display of power, where the strongest and most experienced take on commanding positions. They have specialized tribes with each their own respective leaders, experts in their field. Their vast spread across the world has led to different tribes with their own unique traits.

Rufus might have strength and resourcefulness, but it's armies often lack sophistication and refinement. While their structures stand solid, they still appear wild, barbaric, and rickety. Often their buildings are made of simpler, easier materials and applied however needed. The advantage of this is the materials are easy to make and transport, while they can still also easily find more in the wild. Structurally their structures lack any real loss of value when abandoned or destroyed. However, they still protect them as fierce as any other against anyone who tries to destroy it, saving them time rebuilding, and allowing to smack some folks in the process.

In-game the Rufus faction focuses more on damage, sacrificing speed in return. Using their strength to tame wild beasts that compliment their own physique. These troops are not afraid to put up a display of power, showing their harsh colors, wielding giant weapons with ease. Whether they show their prowess through their outfit or the lack there-off, the enemy will feel their force either way.

With the rise of the new resource 'Essenite', new lands of opportunity open up. Rufus is quick to adapt and take advantage of this new potential strength. With their simplistic construction, using generic building materials, they can easily set up outposts near any newfound deposits. While their hunger for power continues to fuel their efforts.

Finally, here's a preview of some of their structures:
