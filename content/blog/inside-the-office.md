We have an office now! You might have already seen it on Facebook, but we do!

We stole some desks from the floor above us, took them apart an reassembled them in our space. We donated our old monitors and chairs to the company, and we bought some candles and heaps of noodles. We. Are. Set!

We spent most of our Friday moving and decorating, followed by a few hours of cleaning the blinds, which we then proceeded to close, never to open again. (Well.. except for the pictures..)

We are looking for some ideas for things we should have in our office. We already have some good ideas about what we want in here, like a projector for presentations and meetings, a giant painting of our logo on a wall, stickers on the windows, posters on the door, plants, game table, lounge area, swimming pool, books, shelves (for those books), etc. Sadly, we don't think we can fit all of these things in here, so some stuff will have to wait until we own the entire floor, or building…

We will eventually get some of these things, and when we do they'll make this space a little more awesome than it already is.

So, on to whats really what you came here to see: the pictures. They're at the bottom of this post, which you can click on to enlarge.

Again, if you have any awesome ideas to make our awesome office even more awesome-er, please let us know! Also, if you'd like to keep up with further updates about our office or games, be sure to follow us on Twitter and Facebook
