This blog post chronicles a five-day visit to GDC 2019 in San Francisco, attended by the author and three colleagues. The writer, a four-time GDC veteran, documents daily experiences, presentations, and technical insights gained throughout the conference.

## Day 0: Arrival

Tourist activities and pre-registration. The author notes returning after four years and experiencing nostalgia while exploring familiar San Francisco streets.

**First mission**: Rainbow hair color bingo. Mission accomplished within hours—the game development community never disappoints.

## Day 1: Opening Sessions

**"Efficient Rendering in The Division 2"** by Ubisoft Massive & AMD kicked things off with deep technical insights into rendering optimization.

The group plays "rainbow hair color bingo," spotting all spectrum hues within hours. If there's one thing GDC has, it's colorful, creative people.

## Day 2: The Stadia Announcement

**Google Stadia keynote**: The author found it "underwhelming," describing the controller as "just a copy of the Xbox controller."

The promise of game streaming sounded ambitious, but the execution and presentation left something to be desired. Time will tell if this technology takes off.

Sessions on **level design** and **Fortnite mobile development** on Unreal Engine followed, showcasing the technical challenges of bringing AAA experiences to mobile devices.

## Day 3: The Future of Graphics

**Divinity Original Sin 2 postmortem** by Swen Vincke provided valuable insights into the development of one of the most successful RPGs of recent years.

**Oculus Quest** presentation demonstrated the future of standalone VR.

**Nvidia's RTX technology**: The author states: **"RTX on really is a thing of the future"** and anticipates raytracing's dominance in coming years.

This prediction proved prescient—RTX is now industry standard.

## Day 4: Technical Deep Dives

- **Command & Conquer classic postmortem** with live bass performance (because why not?)
- **Spider-Man procedural lighting tools**: How Insomniac created dynamic, beautiful lighting
- **The Division automated testing**: Lessons in QA automation at scale
- **Spider-Man technical postmortem**: A rapid-fire 250 slides covering the engine, tools, and optimization

The Spider-Man talks were particularly impressive—showing how technical excellence and creative vision combine to create unforgettable experiences.

## Day 5: Closing Strong

- **Path of Exile design philosophy** by Chris Wilson: Insights into building a live service game
- **Starlink physics session**: The technical challenges of space combat
- **Global illumination techniques** for large scenes: Cutting-edge rendering research

## Key Learnings

The author expresses enthusiasm about applying GDC learnings to both teaching and Jagaco game development work, noting plans to implement cutting-edge technologies discussed at the conference.

## Takeaways

- **RTX raytracing is the future** (and we were right!)
- Technical excellence requires years of iteration
- The game dev community is vibrant and welcoming
- AAA studios face the same challenges as indies—just at different scales
- Cutting-edge tech is exciting, but execution matters more

## Final Thoughts

GDC 2019 reminded us why we love this industry. The passion, creativity, and technical brilliance on display inspire us to push harder on our own projects.

Time to take these lessons home and build something amazing.
