Building an arcade cabinet proved more challenging than anticipated. The team at Jagaco Games aimed to create a promotional tool for their game Alpha, planning to showcase it at events while enjoying classic arcade games themselves.

## Design Selection

The team selected the Williams Defender design based on its manageable size and relatively straightforward construction. They wanted pre-cut wooden pieces to fit the cabinet inside a compact vehicle for transport to events.

However, sourcing materials proved difficult. Local DIY retailers either couldn't handle the large order or lacked the precision needed for exact dimensions.

## Current Inventory

Despite the wood shortage, significant progress has been made assembling components:

- **Joysticks** for arcade controls
- **LED-equipped buttons** for enhanced gameplay
- **Xin-Mo AW211013 input board** to manage player inputs
- **Coin acceptor** for authenticity and potential revenue
- **Computer hardware** featuring an Intel Core 2 Duo processor and ATI Radeon HD4650 graphics card—sufficient for running arcade titles

## Remaining Items

Still needed for completion:

- Wooden cabinet pieces
- Glass display panels
- Alpha-branded decals and stickers
- Appropriately-sized LCD monitor

The team anticipated receiving wood within the following week, enabling immediate assembly work and documentation through future updates.
