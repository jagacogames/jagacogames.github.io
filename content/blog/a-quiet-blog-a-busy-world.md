It's been a while since our last update, and in this post, we'd like to share why. We'll take you behind the scenes of our development process. Offering a glimpse into the scale of our game, the philosophy guiding our work, and the reason we sometimes go quiet: we're fully immersed in building something ambitious, meaningful, and beautiful. From pixel-perfect art to hundreds of handcrafted quests, we're pouring our hearts into a fantasy RPG that's as expansive as it is personal. Here's what we've been up to and why we believe the wait will be worth it.

You've already seen glimpses of the game we're developing. In this post, we'd like to give you a broader sense of its scale and share a bit about why things might seem quiet on the surface while so much is happening beneath.

Our game is a **pixel art fantasy role-playing game**, handcrafted with care, ambition, and an unwavering belief in the power of storytelling through art.

## By the Numbers

Sometimes, the best way to convey scope is through numbers. So here's a peek behind the curtain:

- **1** world to save
- **8** chapters of story and the same amount of cities to visit and explore
- **29** unique enemy types
- **40+** hours of gameplay
- **49** massive levels to explore
- **80** dungeons, each with its own challenges and purposes
- **99** quest-givers scattered across the world
- **200+** pages of branching story and dialogue
- **400+** pages of game design documentation
- **575** quests (and counting)
- Countless items to find, use, and combine
- Hundreds of NPCs living full lives
- Libraries of books and lore to read
- and tens of thousands of lines of code—engine, editor, and game code alike

## Why So Big?

We understand the conventional wisdom: *small studios should build small games*. It's safer, it's faster, and it's financially sound.

But from the beginning, our goal wasn't to play it safe. We wanted to build the game we've always dreamed of making, the one that keeps us up at night with ideas, the one we'd want to play ourselves. Not because it's profitable, but because we believe in it. Because we love it!

We also believe something deeply: **beauty and perfection take time**. Craftsmanship can't be rushed. Whether it's a single animation frame, a story thread, or the subtle mood of a forest at dusk—we iterate, polish, and refine until it feels just right. Every detail matters, and every detail takes time. We're not chasing deadlines—we're chasing something timeless.

Is it risky? *Without a doubt.*
Is it smart from a business perspective? *Maybe not.*
But is it worth it? *Absolutely.*

We're building a world that we hope players will get lost in. A world filled with wonder, danger, depth, and discovery. That takes time. And sometimes, it means being heads-down, quietly working, forgetting the world around us. But rest assured: silence doesn't mean stillness. It means we're pouring everything we have into this game.

Thanks for sticking with us. We can't wait to show you more in future blogposts.
