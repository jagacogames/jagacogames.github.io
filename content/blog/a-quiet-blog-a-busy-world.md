# A Quiet Blog, A Busy World

The team at Jagaco Games explains their extended silence by revealing the ambitious scope of their pixel art fantasy RPG in development.

## Key Message

**"We're building a world that we hope players will get lost in. A world filled with wonder, danger, depth, and discovery. That takes time."**

## Project Scale

The studio shared specific metrics about their game:

- **8** story chapters with corresponding cities
- **29** unique enemy types
- **40+** hours of gameplay
- **49** massive explorable levels
- **80** dungeons
- **99** quest-givers
- **200+** pages of branching narrative
- **575** quests (ongoing)
- **Hundreds** of NPCs with full lives
- **Tens of thousands** of lines of code

## Development Philosophy

The team emphasizes that **"beauty and perfection take time"** rather than rushing toward deadlines. They acknowledge their approach is risky and perhaps not financially optimal, yet they prioritize craftsmanship and personal vision over conventional industry wisdom about small studio scope.

## Why the Silence?

When you're building something this ambitious, sometimes you need to put your head down and work. Not every development phase produces blog-worthy updates. Sometimes progress looks like:

- Refining systems for the hundredth time
- Balancing difficulty across 80 dungeons
- Writing dialogue for hundreds of NPCs
- Testing and retesting quest chains
- Polishing every pixel

## Our Commitment

We're not chasing trends or rushing to market. We're building the game we want to play—a game that respects players' time and intelligence, that rewards curiosity and exploration, that tells a story worth experiencing.

That takes time. And we think it will be worth the wait.

Thank you for your patience and support. We can't wait to share more with you soon.
